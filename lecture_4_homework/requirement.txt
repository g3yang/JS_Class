This assignment you need to do a hard-core asyn node programming!

Descriptions.

1. Make a GET API call to retrieve all the posts: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
2. Pay attention to the data structure. And you see that one user could have multiple posts.
3. Save all the titles of posts into a file per user with file name user_{{id}}.txt.

    .......
5. You shall have 10 files created. 

Hint:
1. Setup your package.json in a new folder. Figure out the dependencies you need.
2. Use request module to make API call. Look at https://www.npmjs.com/package/request
3. Learn how to use fs to write a file. 
4. Use async library to coordinate the tasks.

   If you have more time, implement it using promises.
